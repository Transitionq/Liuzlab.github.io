---

Reference-based spatial transcriptomics deconvolution often faces inaccuracies due to batch/platform discrepancies between references and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. To tackle this issue, we propose ReSort, a Region-based cell-type Sorting strategy. ReSort extracts spatial regions from ST data, excluding mixture-prone spots, and leverages diverse molecular profiles to create a precise pseudo-internal reference. This approach enables accurate cellular composition estimation in sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics datasets, eliminating the need for external references and potential technical noise.
