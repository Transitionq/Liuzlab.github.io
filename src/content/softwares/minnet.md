The prototype model ranked 2nd and 4th in NeurIPS 2021 Competition – Open Problem in Single-Cell Analysis, and has been published in BMC Bioinformatics (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-05126-7). MinNet specializes in batch correction between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq demonstrated benchmark results, and serves as the first-to-go resource to train tissue-specific integration model.
