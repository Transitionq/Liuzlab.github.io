PARMESAN is a tool that automatically identifies gene-gene and drug-gene relationships described in PubMed and PubMed Central. It then feeds these extracted relationships into a pathway analysis to predict previously unreported relationships. Each relationship is given a confidence score based on the amount and the consistency of the supporting evidence. Higher confidence scores have been shown to correspond to greater consistency with manually curated molecular pathway databases. This tool predicts potential genetic and chemical modulators of over 18,000 human genes.
