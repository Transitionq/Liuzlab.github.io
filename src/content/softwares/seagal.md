---

SEAGAL is a Python package for Spatial Enrichment Analysis of Gene Associations using L-index to detect and visualize spatial gene correlations at both single-gene and gene-set levels. Our package takes spatial transcriptomics datasets with gene expression and the aligned spatial coordinates as input. It allows for analyzing and visualizing genes' spatial correlations and cell types' colocalization within the precise spatial context. Our manuscript has been published in Bioinformatics (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/7/btad431/7223197).
