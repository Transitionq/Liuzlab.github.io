---

MIST detects tissue regions based on their molecular content by maintaining neighboring spots that are both molecularly similar and physically adjacent. Assuming each detected molecular region has a limited number of cell types, MIST then denoises the missing values by approximating a low-rank gene expression matrix through a nuclear-norm minimization algorithm.
