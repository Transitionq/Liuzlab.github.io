---

We introduce a new algorithm based on data-adaptive shrinkage and semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for the detection of unknown batch effects. We test our algorithm on three different datasets – 1) Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC), 2) Topotecan RNA-Seq and 3) Single-cell RNA-Seq on Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). We have demonstrated a superior performance in identifying hidden batch effects as compared to existing algorithms for batch detection in all three datasets. In the Topotecan study, we were able to identify a new batch factor that has been missed by the original study, leading to under-representation of differentially expressed genes. For scRNA-Seq, we demonstrated the power of our method in detecting subtle batch effects.
