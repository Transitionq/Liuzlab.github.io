Alternative splicing of RNA is the key mechanism by which a single gene codes for multiple functionally diverse proteins. Recent studies identified previously unknown class of exons, 'cryptic' exons, in RNA transcripts. These cryptic exons are often associated with various human cancers and neurological disorders. Genome-wise detection of cryptic splice sites can facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms and develop strategies that hope to resolve cryptic splicing with the ultimate goal of therapeutic applications. CrypSplic is a novel cryptic splice site detection method. It uses beta-binomial distribution to model junction count data. Every junction is subjected to a beta binomial test w.r.t conditions and classified to aid molecular inferences.
