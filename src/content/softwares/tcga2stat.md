Large amount of high-throughput data profiled from tumor patients were made publicly available by national projects. However, the process of getting and having these data ready for analyses is intricate for computational researchers, such as statisticians and mathematicians, which hinder them from fully utilizing these abundant resources. We present an open source package, TCGA2STAT, to obtain TCGA data and prepare the data into format ready for statistical analysis in R environment. This package can be seamlessly integrated into computational analyses.
